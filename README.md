# Solutions to different Programming Challenges

My set of solutions to some Programming Challenges I've taken part in.

*DISCLAIMER:* These solutions are usually provided as they were sent, with minimal editing. This means that they've been usually written with the clear goal of solving the problems as quick and dirty as possible. There may contain code that is: hacky, unstylistic, copied and pasted, unreadable, unmainteinable and of course, untested. There are also solutions in languages I barely know.
