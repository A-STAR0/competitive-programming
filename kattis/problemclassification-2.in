problem classification
when reading programming problems one can often get some
hints regarding the topic of the problem by skimming the
problem statement for certain words if for example the
word vertex or edge appears the problem is almost
certainly a graph problem while the words words or
letters suggest that the problem is about strings your
task is to implement a simple program that attempts to
classify a problem according to one of n categories each
category has an associated set of words which if they
appear as words in a statement suggest the problem
belongs to this category when classifying a statement
the program should suggest those categories which have
the highest number of occurences of their associated
words in the above example we suggested that the
category graph may have the associated words vertex
and edge and the category string could have the
associated words words and letters then if there were
occurances each of the words vertex and edge the number
of matches for the category graph would be if the
statement contained occurances of words and of letters
the number of matches for the category string would be 
since there are more matches for the second category
the program should suggest it if there are multiple
categories with the same number of matches your
program should suggest all of them
